# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability please send a message through Discord to @Village#0001
(User ID: 258298021266063360) or open a support ticket on the Discord server
[here](https://rift.mrvillage.dev/discord). Do NOT open a GitHub Issue. Issues
are public and will expose the vulnerability to exploiters between the time it
was reported and is patched.

## Supported Versions

Rift does not follow a versioned system, rather is constantly being updated. Please
be sure to stay as up to date as possible to avoid security issues. In the future the
project may transition to a versioned system.
