        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        1. Rift will not store data that is not necessary for the operation of
        the service or the future operation of the service. For example, log
        data, generated data (tickets, embassies, etc), and Discord models
        (channels, roles, etc) are stored only to provide the service.<br />
        2. All data will be deleted when it is no longer provided to provide the
        service or Rift no longer has access to the data (for example, with
        Discord models).<br />
        3. To request data deletion, please contact @Village#0001
        (258298021266063360) on Discord or open a ticket on the
        <a href="https://rift.mrvillage.dev/discord">support server</a>. <br />
        4. This policy may be changed at any time.
